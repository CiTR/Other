# Studio A Phone-is-Ringing Light Project Documentation

## Project General Summary

[//]: # (Comment: &nbsp featured below is for spacing purposes)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is a light for studio A which turns on whenever a person calls into the studio. It was made per the request of CiTR programmers for a more noticeable phone light in the studio. Before this project, the only available light wasn't very noticeable, meaning programmers would miss call-ins. The project is a simple circuit composed of an Adafruit Neopixel LED Strip which is controlled by an Arudino Nano V3 controller. The controller will turn the LED strip ON/OFF depending if anyone is calling into Studio A.

In this file, all project related information can be found. This includes the circuit diagram, links to all reference websites and documents, a recorded list of encountered issues and their found solutions, and more.
