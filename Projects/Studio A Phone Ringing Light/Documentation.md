# Studio A Phone Light Project Documentation

### Project General Summary

[//]: # (Comment: &nbsp featured below is for spacing purposes)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is a light for studio A which turns on whenever a person calls into the studio. It was made per the request of CiTR programmers for a more noticeable phone light in the studio. Before this project, the only available light wasn't very noticeable, meaning programmers would miss call-ins. The project is a simple circuit composed of an Adafruit Neopixel LED Strip which is controlled by an Arudino Nano V3 controller. The controller will turn the LED strip ON/OFF depending if anyone is calling into Studio A.

This includes the circuit diagram, links to all reference websites and documents, a recorded list of encountered issues and their found solutions, and more.
