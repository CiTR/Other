# Studio A Phone-is-Ringing Light Project Documentation

## Project General Summary

[//]: # (Comment: &nbsp featured below is for spacing purposes)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is a light for studio A which turns on whenever a person calls into the studio. It was made per the request of CiTR programmers for a more noticeable phone light in the studio. Before this project, the only available light wasn't very noticeable, meaning programmers would miss call-ins.
